        <h1>Travel to the rain forest or beach
        
        </h1>
      <p>Rain forests are forests that get a lot of rain. You probably are thinking: Why go there? What if my picnic gets rained out, or my boat gets filled? Good question! But I have an answer. You can still get magical photos and once-in-a-lifetime memories. If you don't have the supplies to go yourself, then follow us on a virtual field trip through the rain forest. Beaches are sandy,  usually  hot areas next to a body of water. On a seaside, you may find seashells. On a bank, which is a type of beach by a lake, river or stream, there is usually surrounding forest. If you would like to see it in person but don't have the tools, follow us on a virtual journey to the beach or a creek.</p>

      <p>It's easy to save and always remember magical moments by capturing the most unmissable pictures, like a magical sunset on a Hawaiian beach or delicious fish in a seaside hotel. Here are some amazing pictures of the beach, some falls, streams or creeks, and some rain forests. </p>

      <p>Kind of suprisingly, this webpage is still in its programming stage! Well... not really. But mostly the font needs to be changed. So... I guess it would be V0.1?

     <p>That's it for now! I will be updating now and then, and then when I'm happy I'm going to stop working on this. Hope you enjoyed this virtual field trip! (Sorry if the food photos got you hungry!) Well, maybe if it's dinnertime, you can have shrimp with dinner? Well, goodbye for now, and I hope you will see my future updates! </p>
